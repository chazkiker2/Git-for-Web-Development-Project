    1. What is Semantic HTML? 
      The practice of using markup to convey the meaning of elements and information 
      rather than just creating the layout of a page.

    2. What is HTML used for? 
      HTML is the base-layer of web development, the building blocks of every website on the internet.
      HTML is used to create and structure websites and applications.

    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? 
      Attributes are additional or required characteristics (or properties, if you rather) of an element, usually formatted in key/value pairs.
      They belong in the opening tag of an element.

    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page?
      h1 tags are used for the biggest headline. Usually the h1 tag is used only once, reserved for the most important title or headline.

    5. Name two tags that have required attributes
      <img src="" alt="" /> 
      <link href="">

    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document? 
      • A link to an external stylesheet with CSS rules
      • A title to display on the Tab of the browser
      • Many times, a programmer might link a font in the head section

    7. What is an id? 
      An id is an attribute attached to an element that acts as a unique identifier ONLY for that element. 
      These id attributes help with selection specificity.

    8. What elements can I add an id to? 
      Any and every element is able to accept an id. However, each element MUST have a unique id.

    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? 
      Only the one time. Repeating id attributes is not appropriate.

    10. What is a class? 
      A class is an attribute used for selection specificity. The class attribute acts as an id for multiple elements.
      It's mainly used to group elements together for certain style rules and is also helpful for organizing code.

    11. What elements can I add a class to? 
      Any and every element is able to accept a class. However, most programmers are very conscious about what elements are receiving which class.

    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? 
      As many times as your heart desires.

    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab?
      Add the attribute target="_blank" inside of your linking element. For instance, see below:
        <a href="https://link.com" target="_blank">LINK</a>

    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for? 
      The alt="" attribute is a required property in the image tag. It is used to convey textual context/information to any 
      users who use a screen reader and cannot view the image itself. 
      If you have a picture of the Twitter logo, you may set your alt attribute equal to "Twitter Logo"

    15. How do I reference an id?
      With the hashtag/pound symbol (or octothorpe, if you're fancy)
      #id-name {
        property: value;
      }

    16. What is the difference between a section and a div
      A section is a semantic element which conveys meaning as to the purpose of the section itself. 
      A div element would WORK instead of a section element, but the section element conveys exactly how that organizer will be used.

    17. What is CSS used for? 
      CSS is used to style HTML; the goal of CSS is to make everything on the webpage look clean, pretty, and perfect.
    
    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page
      By calling out that element and adding curly braces afterward. Example below:
      h2 {
        prop: val;
      }

    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
      A class can be used multiple times on several elements, these are used to group certain elements together and select them all in CSS.
      An id may only be used a single time on a single element. This is used to uniquely specify a single element. A class is not unique and usually applies to multiple elements.

      An example use of an id: <div id="right-sidebar"></div>
      This div might contain the right sidebar of site, so now they can manipulate this sidebar in their CSS by selecting via #right-sidebar.

      An example use of a class: <div class="color-container"></div>
      This div may be used in a style-guide that a programmer makes for themselves when working on a long project. It might have a color name, hex code, and a display of the color itself.
      However, most style guides would have MULTIPLE colors. Thus, every single div containing a color name, code, and display can then be classed as a color-container and manipulated together in CSS via .color-container {}.


    20. How do we select classes in CSS?
      with a period
      .class-selector {
        prop: val;
      }

    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””?
      p.human {
        prop: val;
      }

    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
      

    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?
    24. What is a pseudo selector?
    25. What do we use the change the spacing between lines?
    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
    29. How do I select everything on the page? 
    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?
    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line? 
    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?
    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this? 
    34. Why should I use version control? 
    35. How often should I commit to github?
    36. What is the command we would use to push our repo up to github? 
    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow.
